# Important note
# upon downloading the data to computer, used Goggle sheets to remove columns that will not be required
# columns left in all_weekly_deaths.csv data set: country, region, Population, total Deaths, Covid Deaths, Expected deaths and Non covid deaths
# columns left incountry_vaccination.csv data set:  country, date, total vaccinations, people vaccinated, people fully vaccinated, vaccines and source website
# with a much larger dataset it would be easier to use the SQl Delete function. In this case it was much easier for me 
# The data sets are then imported to DB Browser for SQL Lite using the import.
